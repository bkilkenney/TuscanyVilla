# TuscanyVilla 

This purpose of this project is to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.  Our company provides vacation
getaways to a Tuscany Villa.  Our marketing team has provided mockups for how the site should look.  Tasks for this project:

Required Tasks

 HTML
 Create the base HTML in a file called index.html
 Use semantic elements where appropriate
 Bootstrap
 Use existing bootstrap classes to develop the mobile version first
 Ensure that the layout is responsive - test it in different views
 Address xs, sm, md, and lg sizes as shown in the mockups
 Custom CSS
 Add a custom stylesheet to incorporate more features
 
 Stretch Tasks

Once you've got the basic layout implemented and responsive, it's time to add some pizzazz. Find some images of homes, bring them in, 
and experiment using different CSS techniques to accentuate boxes when the mouse is over them, and/or look into using transitions 
to make them smoothly animated!

 Explore using :hover and CSS transitions to make the site more dynamic
 After you have finished the homepage you can try expanding your design and creating other pages linked from the homepage
 Experiment using additional Bootstrap components that we haven't explored in class.
 
I started by trying to make they layout match that which the marketing team provide.  From there I made rows and columns
to match the design and ensure responsiveness.  Once the layout looked good I added images, text and function to make the 
website come to life. Comments are included in the code to explain what is happening in different sections and 
what I am attempting to do in some areas.  Hope you enjoy!
